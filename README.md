<p align="center"> Most existing screening services require internet services that are not always available to the socioeconomically disadvantaged, despite being the group most at risk for coronavirus. Additionally, websites optimized for desktop usage with too many options may be more difficult to navigate to for senior citizens. Our goal was to create a streamlined approach with fewer practical barriers and technical complications.</p>

<p align="center"> Using Twilio APIs, our team created hotlines that can be either called or texted to help users screen themselves or others for COVID-19 based on factors including but not limited to symptoms, recent travel habits, and pre-existing health conditions. The hotline will make one of four recommendations along with options for additional information on staying safe. </p>

<p align="center"> Based on their responses, those at minimum risk will be asked to continue observing social distancing.</p>

<p align="center"> Those at low to medium risk will be recommended to quarantine themselves at home for at least 14 days.</p>

<p align="center"> Those with medium risk will be warned to self-isolate and to be prepared to seek medical assistance should symptoms worsen.</p>

<p align="center"> Those at medium to high risk will be advised to contact their healthcare providers and be tested for COVID-19.</p>

<p align="center"> Our goal is to help flatten the curve and offer greater accessibility to COVID-19 screening services in these trying times. We hope everyone stays safe. Happy coding! </p>
